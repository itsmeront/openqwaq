Q: Why do Webcam and Video streaming not work in OpenQwaq?

A: For the open source release we had to remove the proprietary H.264 and AAC codecs. We hope the community will help us to come up with suitable open source replacements.

# Details #

The original codecs used are from [MainConcept](http://www.mainconcept.com).

The features of OpenQwaq which use this codec are:

  * Webcam
  * MP4 Movie Playback
  * Session Recording

Please visit the MainConcept licensing pages to determine what kind of license is required, should you wish to use these codecs.
